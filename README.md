# Nanocluster Molecular Dynamics (NCMD)
## Project developed for University of California's Computational Nanomechanics Class (CE237) in Spring 2021.

This is an interactive tutorial for demonstrating molecular dynamics of nanocluster systems using Langevin Dynamics in python. We implement methods from Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) and As Soon As Possible (ASAP). 

Potential - All potential energy calculators in ASE or ASAP are supported in this workflow.

Dynamics - Why Langevin Dynamics?
